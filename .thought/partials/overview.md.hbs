This package is an abstraction of the [bootprint](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint) package.
More docs coming soon.

Bootprint is a tool to generate styled HTML from JSON objects. It uses template modules 
the contain Less definitions and Handlebars templates and partials. The nice thing is, that
Bootprint allows you to override parts of the configuration (a Handlebars-partial or a Less definition)
by merging configuration objects.

Customize is an abstraction of the merging-behaviour. It allows you to create your own projects and engines
(other than Less and Handlebars) and create overridable configurations for those.

At its core, it uses [lodash#merge](https://lodash.com/docs#merge) to merge configurations, but it uses a customizer-function
that also supports promises and custom overrider functions attached to the object.

Currently, there is only one engine ([customize-engine-handlebars](https://npmjs.com/package/customize-engine-handlebars))
and one project that actually uses Customize ([Thought](https://npmjs.com/package/thought)).
Bootprint will use Customize as well, once all features (i.e. like a file watcher) are implemented.
