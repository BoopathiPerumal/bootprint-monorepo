Customize is an abstraction of [bootprint's](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint) the merging-behaviour. 
It allows you to create your own projects and engines (other than Less and Handlebars) and create 
overridable configurations for those.

At its core, it uses [lodash#merge](https://lodash.com/docs#merge) to merge configurations, 
but it uses a customizer-function that also supports promises and custom overrider functions 
attached to the object.

Currently, there is only one engine ([customize-engine-handlebars](https://npmjs.com/package/customize-engine-handlebars))
and one project that actually uses Customize ([Thought](https://npmjs.com/package/thought)).
Bootprint will use Customize as well, once all features (i.e. like a file watcher) are implemented.
