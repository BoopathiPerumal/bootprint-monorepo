# Contributing Guide

## Monorepo setup

A relevant packages of `customize` and `bootprint` have been moved to this
mono-repo, because it seems easier to maintain that way.

The repo is now using `yarn` instead of `npm` and uses "yarn workspaces" and {{npm 'lerna'}}
to manage dependencies between packages in the mono-repo.

`devDependencies` should generally be added to the root package.

## Commit Style / Changelogs

We now use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automatically
generate changelogs.

## Code-Style / Linting

The [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) code-style is enforced through {{npm 'eslint'}} and {{npm 'prettier'}}.
If you are interested in the exact packages to achieve this, have a look at the `package.json` of the root-project.

Files are formatted and lint-fixed on pre-commit using {{npm 'lint-stages'}}, so you usually do not have to
worry about code-style very much. If a commit fails, please consult the git-output for details.
