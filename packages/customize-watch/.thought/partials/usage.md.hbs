## Usage

The following example is almost identical to the
["merging another configuration"-example of the `customize`-module](https://github.com/nknapp/customize#merging-another-configuration).

{{{example 'examples/file-example/example.js'}}}

It will generate the same output, but every time the files in `dir1` and `dir2` are changed, 
removed or added, the output will be recomputed. The `update`-event will be sent with the result
as argument, every time the computation has finished.
