`{{package.name}}` is a file watcher for [customize](https://github.com/nknapp/customize)
It attaches watchers (using [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)) to 
the files and directories that are relevant for computing a result with `customize`.

If files are added, removed or changed the result will be recomputed.
