## Overview

![Bootprint logo](http://nknapp.github.io/bootprint/img/bootprint.svg)

`Bootprint` is a tool for converting JSON-files into static HTML-pages using [{less}](http://lesscss.org),
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com).

It is designed with flexibility in mind:

* You can easily modify the styling by providing your own {less}-files.
* You can easily replace the Handlebars template and any register partial
* You can include custom handlebars-helpers or override existing ones.
* You can create packages with default-configurations, publish them on [npm](http://npmjs.org)
  and use them as base for further customizations.

## Command line usage

`bootprint` itself does not contain any templates, so in order to use `bootprint`, you need to install a template
package (e.g. [bootprint-json-schema](http://npmjs.org/bootprint-json-schema)). Both `bootprint` and the template package
have to be installed globally, so try the following.

```bash
npm install -g bootprint
npm install -g bootprint-json-schema
bootprint json-schema http://json-schema.org/schema target
```

The directory "target" should now contain a file `index.html` and `main.css` which contain a readble
form of the [Core/Validation Meta-Schema](http://json-schema.org).

## Programmatic usage

In order to access `bootprint` through node, you have to have the `bootprint`-module installed locally.

```bash
npm install bootprint
```

Then write you JavaScript-file.

```js
var bootprint = require("bootprint")
    .load(require("bootprint-json-schema"))
    .build("http://json-schema.org/schema","target");

bootprint.generate().done(console.log);
```

`require("bootprint")` returns an instance of the [BootprintBuilder](doc/api.md#BootprintBuilder) class.
This class can be used to load and override configuration settings and finally build a preconfigured instance
of the [Bootprint](doc/api.md#Bootprint) using the `build()` function.

See the [autogenerated API documentation](doc/api.md) for details

More examples can be found in the [bootprint-examples](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint-examples) repository.

Although I haven't done that yet, it should not be too hard to include such a call in a custom Grunt-task.



## Configuration

```js
{
 TODO
}
```


## Development mode

File watcher and live-reload server can be started using the "-d" option of the command-line utility.

## Writing your own Bootprint-modules

There are already a couple of modules and all have a pretty similar structure:

Firstly, you have to define an entry point (usually **index.js**), which is
also registered as `main` in `package.json`.

The file provides a function to enhance a provided BootprintBuilder. The typical pattern is

  ```js
  module.exports = function (builder) {
      return builder
          // Load any modules that this module directly depends on
          .load(require("bootprint-base"))
          // Add custom confiration. Use `require.resolve` to ensure
          // correct paths.
          .merge({
              // Remove keys from this object, if you do not need them
              "partials": path.join(__dirname, "template/"),
              "helpers": require.resolve("./src/handlebars-helper.js"),
              "less": {
                  "main": [
                      require.resolve("./less/main.less")
                  ]
              }
          });
  };
  ```

Next, you can add overriding partials, helpers and {less}-files to the module in order to add functions or override others.

### Avoid name clashes

In order to avoid naming clashes with other modules, you should prefix all
entities of your module with the module name (without the mandatory `bootprint-`-prefix. If you module is named `bootprint-cats`, you should

* prefix all {less}-definitions with `cats--`
* put all partials into a `cats`-subdirectory of the `partials`-directory, so 
  they are registered as `cats/partial-name`.
* prefix all handlebars-helpers with `cats--`.


### Defining an API

If you want your module to be reusable and you want to use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
when maintaining your module, you should define an explicit api.

Here is a convention on how to do that. Eventually, there will be support to generate an
API-documentation automatically based on this convention.

* Document your less-files with jsdoc-like tags. 
  
  * Use the `@public`-tag to mark definitions that should be visible 
    to other modules
    
  * Use the `@readonly`-tag to mark definitions that should not be modified 
    or overridden by another module.
   
  * User the `@override`-tag to mark definitions that override settings from
    other modules.
  
  Example:
  ```css
  /**
   * Label of the `description`-section within a json-schema box.
   * @public
   */
  @json-schema--msg-section-description: "Description";

  ```
   
* Document your handlebars-partials by inserting a comment at the very beginning
  of the file.
  
  * Add a `{{!@public}}`-comment to the beginning of partials that 
    should be visible to other modules.
    
  * Use the `{{!@readonly}}`-comment to the beinning of partials  that should 
    not be modified or overridden by another module.

  Example: `before-body.hbs`
  
  ```hbs
  {{!@public}}{{!This partial can be overridden in order to add custom content in before the existing content}}
  ```
  
* Document the handlebars-helpers using jsdoc-tags. The same rules apply as before.




*See [bootprint-json-schema](http://github.com/nknapp/bootprint-json-schema) for an example, although it does not follow of the above rules yet.*
